# food-truck-locator
A command-line utility that returns the names and addresses of all the currently open food trucks in San Francisco.

### Supported Platforms
Any Linux distro with kernel version 5.4
Windows 10

### Setup
Make sure you have ```python 3.7```  or higher and ```pip3``` installed!
You can check what version of python you are using by running:
```
python --version 
```

**This script will not work with any python version less than 3.7!**

Please refer to their respective docs for installation support.

Once you have python3 and pip3 working correctly on your system,
run the following commands to clone this repo and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/Felipe-ZC/food-truck-locator.git
cd food-truck-locator/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies 
```

After installing dependencies, please create a JSON file named ```config.json```
in ```utils/``` that contains the URL of the Mobile Food Schedule dataset:
```
{
  "host" : "https://data.sfgov.org/resource/jjew-r69b.json"
}
```

The config file is not necessary, however, if no config file
is used, the user MUST specify the host url when creating a 
new ```FoodTruckSchedule``` object:

```
dataSetUrl = "https://data.sfgov.org/resource/jjew-r69b.json"
fts = FoodTruckShedule(dataSetUrl)
```

### Running
To execute the food-truck-locator script, run the following command
in your terminal:
```
python showOpenFoodTrucks.py
```

We can make the showOpenFoodTrucks python script executable on Unix
like systems using the following command:
```
chmod +x showOpenFoodTrucks.py
./showOpenFoodTrucks.py 
```
